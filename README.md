# Four-Squares-Animation-Using-Python
This project uses the python's module "Turtle". 
Install the the module by :


```
pip install turtle
```
Feel free to edit my code as Pablo Picasso is often quoted as saying:
> “Good artists copy, great artists steal.”

And I say :
>"Good coders copy, great coders steal."
